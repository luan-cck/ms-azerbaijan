        <p class="description zen_M">
          In response to the increasing severity of disasters caused by global climate change, we must further promote the
          implementation of climate change adaptation measures.
          For private companies to invest more in adaptation measures, it is essential to enable everyone to assess the return on
          investment in adaptation.
          Our consortium is working on developing digital transformation (DX) to visualize and quantify adaptation value, which
          refers to the economic and environmental impact differences before and after implementing adaptation measures.<br /><br />
          This exhibit is a simulation that visualizes the impact of disaster mitigation before and after the implementation of
          adaptation measures using a 3D model.
          In addition, we introduce examples of adaptation measures that help mitigate disaster damage, as well as the financial
          schemes necessary for their implementation.
